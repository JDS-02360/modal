# modal

A modal text editor for your terminal, written in F#

# Building & Running

To build the program, use the command:

```
dotnet build
```

Then run the outputed executable with the flag `-h`.

```
modal -h
```

This will provide instructions on how to use the editor. Alternatively use the following command to both build and run the program. Note that this will not work with the `-h` flag, as that will provide instructions about using the command:

```
dotnet run
```
